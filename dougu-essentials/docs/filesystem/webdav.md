# WebDAV Protocol Support

WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is an extension of the HTTP protocol that allows clients to perform remote web content authoring operations. The `dougu-essentials` file system abstraction provides support for WebDAV operations with a comprehensive set of capabilities.

## Overview

WebDAV extends HTTP to support collaborative editing and file management on remote web servers. It provides features for:

- Creating, moving, copying, and deleting resources
- Managing properties (metadata) of resources
- Locking resources to avoid conflicts during editing
- Namespace management and collections (folders)

## WebDAV Capabilities

The file system abstraction supports the following WebDAV-specific capabilities:

### Compliance Levels

- `Class1Compliance`: Support for basic WebDAV operations (RFC 4918)
  - GET, PUT, DELETE methods for file manipulation
  - PROPFIND, PROPPATCH for property management
  - MKCOL for collection (folder) creation
  - COPY, MOVE for resource management

- `Class2Compliance`: Advanced features including locking
  - LOCK, UNLOCK methods to prevent the "lost update problem"
  - Exclusive and shared locks
  - Lock discovery and timeout mechanisms

- `Class3Compliance`: Versioning support (RFC 3253)
  - Version history access
  - Working with specific versions
  - Labeling and identification of versions

### Extension Protocols

- `AccessControl`: WebDAV Access Control Protocol (RFC 3744)
  - Principal (user/group) management
  - Access control lists (ACLs)
  - Privilege definitions and inheritance

- `Search`: WebDAV SEARCH method (RFC 5323)
  - Query-based resource discovery
  - Search scope and criteria definition
  - Result formatting options

- `CalDAV`: Calendar extensions (RFC 4791)
  - Calendar collection management
  - Calendar object resource manipulation
  - Free/busy time information
  - Scheduling operations

- `CardDAV`: Address book extensions (RFC 6352)
  - Address book collection management
  - Contact resource manipulation
  - Query and filtering capabilities

### Implementation Features

- `MicrosoftExtensions`: Support for Microsoft's WebDAV extensions
  - Enhanced Windows compatibility
  - Additional property support
  - Performance optimizations for Windows clients

- `NetworkDriveMapping`: Support for mounting as a network drive
  - Operating system integration
  - Seamless file system access
  - Drive letter assignment (Windows)
  - Volume mounting (macOS)

- `ChunkedUploads`: Support for uploading files in chunks
  - Resume interrupted uploads
  - Efficient handling of large files
  - Progress tracking and reporting

## Integration with File System Abstraction

WebDAV capabilities integrate with the core file system abstraction through the `WebDAV` capability flag and the `WebDAVCapability` enum. To check for WebDAV support:

```rust
if fs.capabilities().supports_webdav() {
    // WebDAV protocol is supported
    
    // Check for specific WebDAV capabilities
    if fs.capabilities().has_webdav_capability(WebDAVCapability::Class2Compliance) {
        // Locking is supported
    }
    
    if fs.capabilities().has_webdav_capability(WebDAVCapability::CalDAV) {
        // Calendar operations are supported
    }
}
```

## Practical Considerations

When working with WebDAV implementations, consider the following:

1. **Server Compatibility**: WebDAV implementations vary significantly between servers. Always check specific capabilities before assuming feature support.

2. **Authentication**: WebDAV typically supports HTTP authentication methods (Basic, Digest, OAuth). Ensure proper authentication is configured.

3. **Performance**: WebDAV operations can be more network-intensive than dedicated file protocols. Consider performance implications for large files or numerous small operations.

4. **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies to minimize network requests, especially for property queries.

5. **Error Handling**: WebDAV servers may return standard HTTP error codes along with WebDAV-specific status codes. Implement robust error handling for both.

## Server Software Support

The WebDAV protocol is supported by various server implementations:

- Apache HTTP Server (with mod_dav)
- Microsoft IIS
- Nginx (with extensions)
- Specialized WebDAV servers (SabreDAV, etc.)
- Cloud storage gateways

Each implementation may support different compliance levels and extensions.
