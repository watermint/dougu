# Cloud Object Storage Support

Cloud object storage services provide scalable, durable, and highly available storage for unstructured data. The `dougu-essentials` file system abstraction offers a unified interface for interacting with major cloud object storage providers including Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage.

## Overview

Cloud object storage differs from traditional file systems in several important ways:

- Objects (files) are stored in flat "buckets" or "containers" rather than hierarchical directories
- Objects include metadata and are addressed by unique keys
- Operations are typically performed via HTTP APIs
- Extremely high scalability and durability guarantees
- Pay-for-what-you-use pricing models

## Integration with File System Abstraction

Cloud storage capabilities integrate with the core file system abstraction through the `CloudObjectStorage` capability flag and the `CloudStorageCapability` enum. To check for cloud storage support:

```rust
if fs.capabilities().supports_cloud_storage() {
    // Cloud object storage is supported
    
    // Check for specific provider support
    if fs.capabilities().supports_s3() {
        // Amazon S3 or S3-compatible storage is supported
    }
    
    if fs.capabilities().supports_azure_blob() {
        // Azure Blob Storage is supported
    }
    
    if fs.capabilities().supports_gcp_storage() {
        // Google Cloud Storage is supported
    }
    
    // Check for specific features
    if fs.capabilities().has_cloud_storage_capability(CloudStorageCapability::MultipartUpload) {
        // Large files can be uploaded in parts
    }
    
    if fs.capabilities().has_cloud_storage_capability(CloudStorageCapability::ObjectVersioning) {
        // Objects can have multiple versions
    }
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

When working with cloud object storage, consider the following:

1. **Path Abstraction**: Cloud object storage typically uses flat namespaces with key prefixes to simulate folders. The file system abstraction maps these to a more traditional path-based approach.

2. **Eventual Consistency**: Some cloud storage services offer eventual (rather than strong) consistency. Applications should account for this when performing sequential operations.

3. **Cost Implications**: Cloud storage operations incur costs based on storage amount, request count, data transfer, and other factors. The abstraction should be used with cost-efficiency in mind.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Consider using appropriate buffer sizes, parallelism, and transfer acceleration features for optimal performance, especially for large objects.

5. **Region Selection**: Data locality affects both performance and compliance. Consider using region-specific endpoints when available.

## Provider-Specific Features

Each cloud provider offers unique features that may be exposed through the abstraction:

### Amazon S3
- S3 Select for in-place queries
- Intelligent-Tiering for automatic cost optimization
- Transfer Acceleration for faster uploads/downloads
- Access Points for customized access policies

### Azure Blob Storage
- Tiered Blob Storage (Hot, Cool, Archive)
- Immutable storage policies
- Blob Index for metadata search
- Soft delete and undelete capabilities

### Google Cloud Storage
- Object hold and retention
- CMEK (Customer-Managed Encryption Keys)
- Autoclass for automatic storage class optimization
- Pub/Sub notifications for object changes

The abstraction aims to provide a common interface while still exposing provider-specific capabilities where appropriate.
