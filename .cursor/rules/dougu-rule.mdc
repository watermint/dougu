# Project wide rules

* Do not change Rust edition. Use Rust 2024 edition.
* Write comments concisely to explain the intent of the processing and the specifications of functions, structs, traits and variables.
* Do not add comments that obvious from the code (e.g. // Import XXX, // Keep this).
* When rewriting a process, delete the previous process instead of commenting it out.
* Backward compatibility is not required for this project.
* Do not perform fallback processing due to lack of resource or other issues. Instead, process as “fail fast.”

# dougu-essentials

`dougu-essentials` is responsible for aggregating external dependency crates. When adding external dependency crates in sub-crates other than `dougu-essentials`, please check them carefully.

When implementing modules under `dougu-essentials`, please be careful not to expose external crate modules to other subcrates. Create or update wrappers to hide these external crates completely.

* Use `dougu-essentials::core` instead of anyhow, thiserror
* Use `dougu-essentials::time` instead of chrono
* Use `dougu-essentials::obj` instead of serde, serde_json
* Use `dougu-essentials::i18n` for any i18n/l10n related process
* Use `dougu-essentials::log` for logging
* `dougu-essentials::fs` contains local file system, publicly defined protocols such as (S)FTP, CIFS/SMB, NFS, and WebDAV. This module must not have concrete implementations for cloud services such as Dropbox or S3. But have documentations for each file system knowledge which used to define interfaces.
